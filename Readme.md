# About dataset
In this repository I train some models (Linear regression, XGBoost Regression, Simple Nueral Network and GradientBoostingRegressor) on a dataset with 99 samples. features of this dataset are relate to acid injection. We want to predict pore volume break through (PVBT).

# Challenges and Solutions
The main challenge of this dataset is its small size. By removing outliers and using simple models we fix this problem.
